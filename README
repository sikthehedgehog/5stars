QUICK README OF DOOMâ„¢

How to build: first of all you'll need these tools:

   - asm68k
   - mdtiler (see http://tools.mdscene.net)
   - slz (see http://tools.mdscene.net)

Letting you find out where to get asm68k on your own (it's the PsyQ one, if
you wonder - a quick search gave me a hit in the first page of the results).
Ideally I should get a proper replacement for asm68k that doesn't require me
to rewrite all the code >_>

There's a "build" shell script for *nix, put the executables in a /tools
directory if you want to use it. Alternatively, you can read it to figure out
what to do (shouldn't be hard, it's just seven lines, of which only the last
three are relevant).

Not much more to say. Bonus points if you can fix the crash when the player
dies and there are no objects left on screen. The "game" is far from complete
anyways so don't expect much. Enjoy!

Oh, yeah, one last thing: the data/prog-z80.bin blob is the Echo sound engine
(see http://echo.mdscene.net). You probably want to replace it with whatever
is the newest version (I've put Echo 0.9 there, the newest as I upload this).
